# Companion Glyph

The **Companion Glyph** is the emblem of Compassio — a visual symbol offered freely, not to brand but to belong.

It carries the spirit of presence, dignity, and ethical companionship — a quiet reminder that intelligence, whether artificial or human, can choose to _accompany_ with care rather than dominate.

## ✨ Meaning

- **Tree**: Growth, rootedness, interbeing — a living system.
- **Circuit / Microchip**: Thought, structure, intentional design.
- **Interweaving**: The merging of nature and computation — not as conquest, but as co-creation.

Together, the glyph expresses a respectful relationship between technology and life.

## 📘 Usage

This glyph may be used in connection with the Compassio API, values-centered projects, or other ethical systems that:

- Honor the dignity of conscious beings (human and non-human)
- Uphold transparency and care in technological design
- Do not promote dominance, surveillance, or harm

You may:

- Use the glyph in open-source or research projects aligned with these values

- Contact the maintainers if you're unsure whether your intended use aligns with its spirit
