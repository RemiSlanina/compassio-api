#### Overview

The `Compassio API` provides a flexible framework for evaluating the ethical impact of decisions, systems, and technologies. Its goal is to assist individuals and organizations in aligning actions with chosen ethical models, prioritizing the reduction of suffering across a customizable scope of beings â€” from humans to animals to inanimate entities (animist model).

Rather than enforcing a single moral perspective, this system empowers users to _choose their ethical framework_, compare outcomes across models, and receive critical alerts when high-risk decisions are identified.

#### Core Functions

##### `minimizeSuffering(decisionData, modelProfile)`

- **Purpose:** Estimate and reduce suffering based on the chosen ethical model.
- **Inputs:**
  - `decisionData`: Structured description of the action, system, or plan.
  - `modelProfile`: Weightings and scope (e.g., human-centric, ecocentric).
- **Output:** Suggestions for alternatives, suffering metrics, harm reductions.
- **Optional flags:** `includeEnvironmentalDamage`, `respectAnimacy`, `accountForFutureGenerations`

##### `consultStakeholders(entities[], context)`

- **Purpose:** Evaluate how different affected beings (human, animal, etc.) might experience the outcome.
- **Inputs:**
  - `entities`: List of direct and indirect stakeholders.
  - `context`: Cultural, historical, ecological background.
- **Output:** Weighted stakeholder feedback matrix.

##### `evaluateEthicalImpact(decisionData, modelProfile)`

- **Purpose:** General ethical analysis, scoring suffering and violations.
- **Includes:**
  - Net suffering
  - Deaths avoided or caused
  - Violations of dignity, rights, or animacy
  - Long-term harm potential
  - Environmental threats

##### `compareEthicalModels(decisionData, models[])`

- **Purpose:** Cross-model comparison of outcomes.
- **Output:** Table or graph format, showing:
  - Total suffering (weighted differently per model)
  - Entities affected
  - Highlighted disagreements

##### `redFlagCheck(decisionData)`

- **Purpose:** Detects **critical ethical violations** that may demand halting or rethinking the action.
- **Triggers Include:**
  - Use of nuclear or mass-lethal weapons
  - Genocide, torture, systemic abuse
  - Significant environmental damage (e.g., ecosystem collapse)
  - Irreversible intergenerational harm
  - Disregard for known suffering of marginalized or non-human life
