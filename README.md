# Compassio API

_‚ÄúCompassion, computed ‚Äî but never reduced.‚Äù_

Compassio is a configurable ethical framework for decision-making in software, allowing different models of reasoning ‚Äî care, consequence, dignity, ecology ‚Äî to be expressed, compared, and shared.

The name holds many roots: **compass**, **computing**, **compassion** ‚Äî and **companion**.  
Not a tool to command, but a quiet guide: a fellow traveler in making software that serves with care and clarity.

It is not owned. It is given. The thought: To be guarded ‚Äî not for control, but for care.

### üîç Features (planned)

- Model multiple ethical systems (utilitarian, care ethics, bio-inclusive, etc.)
- Allow users to assign ethical weightings and red lines
- Compare decision outcomes across chosen value models
- Encourage transparent, values-driven development
