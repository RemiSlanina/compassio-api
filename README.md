# Compassio API

_“Compassion, computed — but never reduced.”_

Compassio is a configurable ethical framework for decision-making in software, allowing different models of reasoning — care, consequence, dignity, ecology — to be expressed, compared, and shared.

The name holds many roots: **compass**, **computing**, **compassion** — and **companion**.  
Not a tool to command, but a quiet guide: a fellow traveler in making software that serves with care and clarity.

It is not owned. It is given. The thought: To be guarded — not for control, but for care.
