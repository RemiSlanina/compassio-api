#### Overview

This document provides illustrative examples of how the Compassio API might be used in different domains. Each case shows how ethical models can produce different evaluations, enabling users to make more informed and compassionate decisions.

### Use Case 1: Wartime Targeting Decision

**Scenario:** A military force must decide whether to target a site with mixed civilian and military presence.

**Models Compared:**

- **Utilitarian (human-centric):** Minimizes human casualties and long-term suffering.
- **Care Ethics:** Prioritizes relational harm, trauma, and context of vulnerability.
- **Bio-inclusive:** Accounts for local animal life, ecosystems, and intergenerational effects.

**API Use:**

- `evaluateEthicalImpact()` shows severe projected suffering in all models.
- `compareEthicalModels()` highlights that the bio-inclusive model strongly opposes targeting due to habitat destruction.
- `redFlagCheck()` triggers due to high risk of irreversible harm.

**Output:** Urges exploring alternatives (e.g., evacuation, diplomacy) before engaging. Flags as morally high-risk.

### Use Case 2: Emergency App Design for Disaster Zones

**Scenario:** A tech firm is designing a mobile app to help coordinate aid after a flood, with AI-driven triage.

**Models Compared:**

- **Utilitarian:** Focuses on maximizing lives saved.
- **Justice-Based (Equity):** Prioritizes marginalized groups who may be underserved.
- **Care Ethics:** Considers emotional support, relational continuity, and community resilience.

**API Use:**

- `consultStakeholders()` suggests elderly and disabled people are often left out in current triage systems.
- `minimizeSuffering()` recommends features like offline access, emotional tone adjustments, and inclusive visuals.

**Output:** Highlights trade-offs. Utilitarian model prioritizes efficiency, while justice and care ethics suggest redesigning parts to avoid harm to overlooked users.

### Use Case 3: Urban Planning â€“ Building a Smart City District

**Scenario:** A new smart district is planned, including sensors, surveillance, green zones, and traffic rerouting.

**Models Compared:**

- **Technocratic Efficiency Model:** Optimizes traffic and energy usage.
- **Environmental Ethics:** Focuses on biodiversity, heat islands, and green connectivity.
- **Animist/Care Hybrid:** Views places and objects as embedded in relational networks (e.g., trees, waterways).

**API Use:**

- `evaluateEthicalImpact()` reveals increased surveillance may cause psychological harm and social distrust.
- `compareEthicalModels()` surfaces the conflict between optimization and environmental/community well-being.
- `redFlagCheck()` warns about irreversible soil sealing and local species loss.

**Output:** Suggests a redesign prioritizing green roofs, public input, and minimal surveillance. Conflicting goals are made visible for resolution.
