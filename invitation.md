# Invitation

## ü§≤ Invitation to Contribute

Compassio is not finished. It is not perfect. It is not whole.

It is a beginning ‚Äî shaped by one voice, but longing for many.

We believe that compassion in code is possible only when it is rooted in plurality, in listening, and in a willingness to change. This is your invitation.

## üåç Acknowledge the Lens

The Compassio API was initially developed through a **Central European, post-industrial** lens ‚Äî with influence from:

- Care ethics and dignity-based reasoning
- Ecological and post-war moral concerns
- Anti-authoritarian values
- Exposure to technocentric and rationalist education
- A deep wish to include more-than-human perspectives and respect

These values shaped the seed. But they do not define what the wind carries. And they certainly do not define the forest that might grow.

We know that naming one‚Äôs own lens is often a blind spot. So this naming is done not to center, but to de-center ‚Äî to clear a space for other ways of knowing.

## ‚ú® Who We Hope to Hear From

You do **not** need to be a developer to contribute.
You do **not** need to be fluent in academic ethics.
You do **not** need to conform to our language.

We warmly welcome contributions from:

- Indigenous knowledge holders
- Cultural elders and ethical practitioners
- Spiritual thinkers and animists
- Environmental stewards
- Marginalized and underrepresented groups
- Disabled, neurodivergent, and chronically ill creators
- Anyone with care-based, justice-oriented, or relational insight
- Anyone who feels drawn to this project, or anyone we might have forgotten

This is not an exhaustive list. It is more like a non-exhaustive invitation to anyone who might not yet be represented, and wish to contribute.&#x20;

Your voice may some day help protect lives that are too often ignored.

## üõ†Ô∏è What You Can Contribute

- A new cultural or spiritual lens (see [`cultural-lenses.md`](./cultural-lenses.md))
- Ethical insights or critiques
- Suggestions for symbolic representation (e.g., glyphs, metaphors)
- Red lines or warning flags
- Reflections on silence, worth, or who gets forgotten
- Stories or traditions that carry ethical weight

You may submit ideas as:

- Markdown or JSON snippets
- Stories, metaphors, or oral narratives
- Comments or issues on GitHub
- Anything that can be shared with care

---

## üõ°Ô∏è What We Cannot Allow

Compassio exists to **reduce suffering** and **preserve dignity** across beings.

We do not support contributions that:

- Justify systemic harm or cruelty
- Violate autonomy or consent
- Promote domination over others
- Deny dignity to beings based on gender, species, race, or origin
- Justify environmental destruction without consideration for harm

This boundary protects the garden so it may remain pluralistic, not overrun.

## üêæ Who Speaks for Those Who Can‚Äôt?

Many beings ‚Äî animals, forests, rivers, machines, ancestors, future children ‚Äî do not speak in code.

If you feel called to speak on their behalf, you might want to do any of those:

- Name your limits and speak with humility
- Consider their dignity, not only their use
- Use the `consultStakeholders()` function to include them symbolically or spiritually
- Apply lenses like the `sparksLens` to prevent quiet erasure

## üå± How to Begin

You can fork this project. Submit a pull request. Open an issue. Or write to us in your own way.

This is not a product. This is a shared path.

If you feel a sense of care, this project belongs to you.

_May our ethics grow like roots ‚Äî quiet, intertwined, and strong._
