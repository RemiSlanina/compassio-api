# Ethics

Compassio is not merely a tool — it is an offering in service of compassionate technology.

### ⚖️ Core Principle

This work may **not** be used to justify or assist in actions that **violate the dignity of conscious beings** — human or non-human.

This includes (but is not limited to):

- Justifying acts of cruelty, exploitation, or large-scale ecological harm
- Use in surveillance or control systems that violate autonomy
- Deployment in deception, manipulation, or extractive systems

### 🤝 Stewardship

This project welcomes contribution in the spirit of:

- Care and humility
- Respect for plural ethical systems
- The protection of vulnerable lives

It is not neutral. It is a companion.
