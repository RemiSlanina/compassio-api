## ðŸŒ± Compassio API â€” Core Features Overview

_"Compassion, computed â€” but never reduced."_

Compassio is a modular ethical system designed to help individuals and communities evaluate decisions, systems, and technologies with care, clarity, and flexibility.

It empowers contributors â€” technical or not â€” to participate in creating ethical tools that adapt to multiple worldviews, protect vulnerable life, and seek repair over domination.

### ðŸ§­ Core Functional Modules

| Feature                         | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modular Ethics Models**       | Users can select different suffering models (e.g. human-centric, bio-inclusive, animist) to define what counts as harm and whose suffering matters.   |
| **Lenses**                      | Modifiers like `sparks`, `fragility`, or `deepTime` can be layered over base models to refine perception and ethical sensitivity.                     |
| **Red Flag Detection**          | Critical alerts for actions likely to cause mass harm, irreversible damage, or violate dignity (e.g. genocide, ecocide, torture, nuclear deployment). |
| **Ethical Comparison**          | Compares the projected impact of decisions across multiple ethical lenses, surfacing both alignments and contradictions.                              |
| **Stakeholder Consultation**    | Evaluates a decision from the perspective of various affected beings â€” human, animal, symbolic, future â€” with optional weightings.                    |
| **Dynamic Weighting**           | Ethical models allow users to adjust how suffering is calculated (e.g., weigh animal life higher, or future generations more heavily).                |
| **Explanation & Justification** | Offers clear summaries explaining why a decision is flagged, favored, or rejected â€” grounded in ethical logic.                                        |
| **Interface-Agnostic Output**   | Designed for flexibility â€” can be used in command-line tools, graphical interfaces, voice apps, or non-digital contexts.                              |
| **Contributor-Friendly Design** | Includes documentation for non-coders to propose ideas, models, or revisions â€” including artwork, poetry, or lived experience notes.                  |

Explanations/Examples:
Symbolic - Beings or systems not literally sentient â€” but treated with meaning, respect, or cultural presence.

- A river considered sacred in an Indigenous worldview
- A graveyard, monument, or tree planted in memory of someone

### âœ¨ Future Extensions (Dream List)

- **Memory-aware Decision Trees**: Store reasoning paths and past ethical decisions for transparency and reflection.
- **Compassion Weight Buffering**: Temporarily soften output in emergencies or trauma contexts.
- **Translation Engine**: Translate outputs into different cultural or ethical dialects (e.g. Ubuntu, Buddhist ethics, Indigenous protocols).
- **Shared Dignity Score**: A single value derived from the least-respected stakeholder in the model â€” used to highlight blind spots.
