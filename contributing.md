# Contributing

## 🤝 Contributing to Compassio

Welcome. This project is shared in hope.

You do not need to be a coder, ethicist, or expert to contribute.
If you care about compassion, dignity, and systems that serve life — you are welcome here.

## 🌿 Ways to Contribute

- Suggest new ethical models or lenses (e.g. deep ecology, Ubuntu, Buddhist ethics)
- Add lived experience insights — especially from underrepresented or vulnerable communities
- Share examples, metaphors, or cultural viewpoints
- Submit artwork, glyphs, or poetic interpretations
- Help refine clarity, language, or accessibility in documentation
- Ask questions, challenge assumptions, or bring missing voices
- Invite others to collaborate or dream with us

All respectful contributors are companions here.

## ✨ Guidelines

- Be kind. Be curious.
- Respect plural perspectives — even when they differ from your own.
- Focus on care, not control.
- Offer what you can — even small seeds grow.

## 🌍 Ethics Across Cultures

We welcome contributions inspired by diverse ethical traditions, including (but not limited to):

- Ubuntu ("I am because we are")
- Buddhist compassion and interdependence
- Indigenous protocols of respect and relationality
- Islamic and Jewish ethics of care and justice
- Feminist care ethics
- Taoist and Confucian harmony

If you're unsure how to describe your tradition in system terms — just share what you know. We'll help translate its spirit.

## ✏️ How to Propose a Model or Lens

You can submit a new idea in any form:

- Markdown document
- Sketch, visual, or poetic piece
- Short message describing the idea

### Example Prompt:

> “I’d like to propose a model that centers water bodies as beings. In this model, a river can suffer when polluted, and its dignity matters.”

We'll help structure it and link it into the Compassio system.

## 🧠 Sharing from Lived Experience

We especially value:

- Stories from disabled, chronically ill, neurodivergent, or marginalized contributors
- Perspectives on harm or care often ignored by mainstream ethics
- Suggestions based on real needs, failures, or moments of dignity

You don’t need to speak academic language. Speak your truth.

> _“If it hurt you, it matters. If it helped you, it belongs here.”_

We’re glad you’re here.
Let this project become a place of ethical kinship.
A compass, carried by many hands.
