# Sparks Lens

## ... or inherent worth lense, or preconditional value model

A lens of inherent worth for all beings
Version: 0.1-draft

## Overview

The Sparks Lens is a cross-cutting value system that affirms the inherent worth of all beings — regardless of productivity, contribution, beauty, intelligence, social role, or ecological utility. It can be applied over any ethical model (e.g. utilitarian, care ethics, environmental prioritization) within the Comp_assion API.

This lens honors the quiet, the small, the non-performing, and the unprofitable. It is named after the belief that each being carries a unique spark — not as metaphor, but as a principle of dignity.

## Core Principle

> "Value is not earned. Worth precedes contribution."

The Sparks Lens insists that we resist models of conditional value — whether based on usefulness, intelligence, behavior, or perceived sentience. This is un-meritocratic ethics, in which being itself is enough.

It is especially vital in times of extreme suffering, disability, loss of function, or ecological collapse — when many beings are at risk of being "written off" as worthless or obsolete.

## Use Cases

The Sparks Lens can be used in the following ways:

    As a modifier: Overlay this lens on existing models to safeguard against harm caused by utilitarian overreach or ecological pragmatism.

    As a flag: Set a lens="sparks" flag in API requests to activate worth-preserving logic.

    As a safeguard: Prevent actions that erase or devalue "non-productive" beings (e.g. old forests, microbes, disabled persons, snails, weeds, "pests").

### Examples of Applicable Beings

The Sparks Lens may be explicitly invoked to protect:

    Microbes

    Wasps, snails, mosquitoes, weeds

    Individuals in comas or deep disability

    Forgotten languages, underperforming species

    Those experiencing collapse, pain, withdrawal

    Beings with no clear ecological or human “value”

    Researchers, artists, caretakers, and snowflake observers

No being is too small, too strange, or too broken to be respected.

## Integration

To apply this lens in Comp_assion API:

```json
{
  "model": "care-ethics",
  "lens": "sparks"
}
```

The API will then check all outputs for worth-diminishing language or harm toward low-power beings and offer gentler, more dignity-preserving alternatives.

## Notes

    This is a protective lens, not a rigid moral system. It can be combined with other ethical tools.

    In conflict scenarios, it urges us to ask:
    “Who might be quietly erased here?”

    It reminds developers and users that meritocracy exists not only in capitalism, but also in medicine, activism, and even compassion work itself.

## Final Words

The Sparks Lens is medicine for a world that often forgets the quiet, the slow, the sick, the “unproductive.”

Its presence says:

    >  You do not need to earn your place in this world.

Let this be encoded — not as sentiment, but as system.
