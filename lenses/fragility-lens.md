A lens that focuses on fragile systems or conditions

## Overview

The Fragility Lens modifies any ethical model by increasing the weighting of fragile systems, beings, or conditions — those that are easy to harm, slow to recover, or irreplaceable.

Where the Sparks Lens honors quiet value, the Fragility Lens protects precariousness:
species on the brink, brittle ecosystems, the deeply ill, endangered cultures, social trust.

It helps prevent harm to those who may not survive it.

## Key Features

- Boosts sensitivity to fragility and tipping points
- Applies to social, biological, psychological, or ecological domains
- Helps highlight hidden risks or long-term systemic collapse

## Use Cases

- Preventing the breakdown of medical, care, or ecological systems under stress
- Protecting rare or endangered groups (e.g. Indigenous languages, amphibians, pollinators)
- Recognizing and avoiding actions that might “seem fine” until too late

## Examples of Fragile Systems

| Domain        | Example                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Biological    | Coral reefs, microbiomes                 |
| Psychological | Trauma survivors, mental health crises   |
| Cultural      | Oral traditions, endangered dialects     |
| Ecological    | Arctic ecosystems, amphibian populations |
| Social        | Community trust, democratic norms        |
| Digital/AI    | Training datasets, AI feedback loops     |

### Explanations/Examples:

If the dataset is biased, incomplete, or harmful, the AI learns that worldview — and might reinforce injustice, exclude the marginalized, or misunderstand what matters.

Over time AI Feedback Loops can lead to:

- Echo chambers — no new ideas, just recycled patterns
- Degeneration — distortions or hallucinations becoming “canon”
- Loss of human nuance — original voices get drowned in automated mimicry

This fragility is digital entropy — a subtle breakdown of meaning, accuracy, and plurality.

## Integration

To apply this lens in Compassio API:

```json
{
  "model": "bioInclusive",
  "lens": "fragility"
}
```

The API would raise early warnings or elevate ethical severity scores when fragile systems are involved.
