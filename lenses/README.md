# Lenses

## 🌿 About This Folder: Lenses in Compassio

This folder contains ethical **lenses** — perspectives used to evaluate suffering, dignity, and moral weight across beings. A lens might be cultural, spiritual, philosophical, ecological, or symbolic.

Unlike rigid models, lenses are flexible, living, and open to interpretation. They may guide decisions, raise new questions, or reveal what a narrow system might miss.

---

## 🔍 Purpose of Lenses

Each lens describes:

- What kinds of beings or systems are seen as ethically relevant
- What values or relationships are honored
- How suffering or dignity is interpreted and weighted

Lenses may be combined, compared, or layered. Some are designed to complement ethical models (like utilitarian or care ethics); others are entire worldviews.

## 🕊️ A Note on Climate and Culture

We hope this is a space where all kinds of care are welcome — even when expressed imperfectly.

You do not need perfect language to belong here. If you are learning, grieving, reaching, or trying — you are welcome. Mistakes made with care are part of growth.

We invite thoughtfulness, not fear. We honor critique, not cruelty.

Some of us move slowly. Some carry pain. Some don’t always know what to say. That’s part of this, too.

Let us hold each other gently, and build something worth offering.

## 🤲 Final Thought

Compassio does not ask you to adopt one way of seeing. It asks:

> What do you see, when you look with care?

We welcome your lens.

_“To see differently is not to divide. It is to offer depth.”_
