### Suffering Models

#### Overview

The `Compassio API` allows users to select from a range of ethical lenses ("suffering models") to evaluate harm and well-being. Each model determines **what counts as suffering**, **whose suffering counts**, and **how suffering is weighted**. This modular approach supports transparency, user autonomy, and pluralism.

---

#### Core Suffering Models

##### 1. `humanCentric`

- **Scope:** Humans only.
- **Weighting:** All humans equal.
- **Use case:** Classic human rights contexts, initial policy drafts.

##### 2. `sentienceBased`

- **Scope:** All sentient beings (humans, mammals, birds, etc.).
- **Weighting:** Typically proportional to cognitive/emotional complexity (configurable).
- **Note:** Aligns with many animal ethics models.

##### 3. `bioInclusive`

- **Scope:** All life forms, including plants and microbes.
- **Weighting:** Often lower for non-sentient organisms, but configurable.
- **Use case:** Ecosystem planning, biocentric ethics.

##### 4. `ecoSystemic`

- **Scope:** Includes non-living systems (rivers, climate, soil).
- **Weighting:** Based on ecological role, stability, or symbolic value.
- **Use case:** Environmental policy, land use, climate resilience.

##### 5. `animist`

- **Scope:** All entities, even inanimate (e.g., machines, mountains).
- **Weighting:** May include spiritual, cultural, or animacy-based factors.
- **Use case:** Culturally respectful design, indigenous knowledge systems.

##### 6. `intergenerational`

- **Scope:** Future beings, both human and non-human.
- **Weighting:** Often discounted over time (configurable).
- **Use case:** AI safety, sustainability planning.

##### 7. `objectRespect`

- **Scope:** Inanimate objects as respected companions or symbols.
- **Weighting:** Low, optional.
- **Use case:** Symbolic models, care ethics extension.

##### 8. `deepTime` (as a model?)

- **Scope:** Far-future beings, planetary systems, irreversible legacies
- **Weighting:** Extremely high for irreversible or extinction-level effects
- **Time Horizon:** 500–100,000+ years
- **Use case:** Climate policy, species extinction, AI alignment, nuclear risk, deep ecology

#### Additinal lens

Additional lenses to focus through

##### Sparks Lens

- **Scope:** Applicable to all beings or models, weights worth before deserving or utility
- **Weighting:** Low, optional.
- **Use case:** Avert biased decisions. Values all kinds of lives.

##### Fragility Lens

- **Scope:** Applicable to all beings or models, weights vulnerability and irreversibility
- **Weighting:** Low, optional.
- **Use case:** Avert biased decisions. Values what might be gone for good.

##### Deep Time (as a lens?)

- **Scope:** Applicable to all beings or models, weights long term impact
- **Weighting:** Low, optional.
- **Use case:** Future generations and lives/beings.

#### Possible Weight Systems (First Draft)

##### Comparison Table (Draft)

| Entity or Impact                   | Suggested Weight       |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Human extinction                   | 1.0                    |
| Non-human extinction               | 0.9                    |
| Ocean acidification                | 0.8                    |
| Nuclear contamination (half-lives) | 0.8                    |
| Irreversible ecosystem loss        | 0.85                   |
| Permanent language loss            | 0.6                    |
| Unrecoverable cultural erasure     | 0.7                    |
| Planetary system disruption        | 0.9                    |
| Future unknown lives               | 0.5–1.0 (configurable) |

##### Why this matters

This model gives voice to the unborn, and weight to the kinds of decisions that no one now alive can ever undo. It echoes the thought: that just because a being or era is not present, doesn't mean it doesn't suffer.

In a way, this is also a grief-aware model. It points out that some losses might ripple for millennia.
